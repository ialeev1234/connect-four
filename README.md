# connect-four
Console game. Python3.6

Your task is to create a console based version of the classic game Connect Four. The
presentation can be kept as simple as possible. For example, you could print the current board
only when requested. You should be able to select the column to drop your disc into. The board
consists of 6 columns that are 7 rows high. An empty cell should be represented as ‘O’, player 1
as the number ‘1’, player 2 as the number ‘2’. This should function as a 2 player game. For extra
credit you can implement an AI opponent (this could be player ‘2’ for example).
